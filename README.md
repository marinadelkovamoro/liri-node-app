# liri-node-app

Meet LIRI. 

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, requests will be sent to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs using the axios package.
